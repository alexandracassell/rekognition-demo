## Amazon Rekognition Celebrity Detection Ios

iOS Swift project code for identifying celebrities using Amazon Rekognition

## Steps to use

1. Enter your cognito identity pool id to authenticate against Amazon Rekognition APIs
1. Build the app to your device and confirm that the app is working and making calls to
Amazon Rekognition. If you have a clickable “Jeff Bezos” label for the celebrity in the
image, the app is working! Now go ahead and snap a pic of a celebrity on your TV
screen, in a magazine, or in person. If everything works, you should see a label on
the face in the image that Amazon Rekognition has identified as a celebrity. Clicking
on the identified celebrity takes you to the celebrity’s IMDb profile page. Note that
the app supports a camera image or an image from the phone's photo library.
